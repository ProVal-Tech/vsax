# Tasks

Folder for storing tasks for VSA X.

## Instructions

- Duplicate `_template.toml`.
- Rename `_template.toml` to match your task name (e.g., `your-task-name.toml`).
- Name your file using `kebab-case`.
- Update the values in `your-task-name.toml` as needed.
- Remove any unnecessary sections from `your-task-name.toml`.

## Notes

- All tasks should be placed within the `ProVal` task folder.
- If needed, you may create sub-folders, but they must be located inside the `ProVal` directory.
