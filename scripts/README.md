# Scripts

Folder for storing scripts for VSA X.

## Instructions

- Create a new directory for your script inside the `Scripts` folder.
- Name your files and folders using `kebab-case`.
- Copy `_template.toml` from the `_template` directory into your script's directory.
- Rename `_template.toml` to match your script name (e.g., `your-script-name.toml`).
- Update the values in `your-script-name.toml` as needed.
- Remove any unnecessary sections from `your-script-name.toml`.
- Copy any required script template files into your directory and rename them appropriately.
- Do not include auto-generated `Inputs` or `Output` code in your scripts; VSAX will add these automatically during variable creation.

## Notes

- All scripts should be placed within the `ProVal` script folder.
- If needed, you may create sub-folders, but they must be located inside the `ProVal` directory.
